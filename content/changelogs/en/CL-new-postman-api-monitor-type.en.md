Along with the current [Multi-step API]({{< ref path="/support/kb/synthetic-monitoring/api-monitoring/multi-step" lang="en" >}}), [Webservice Http and Webservice Https]({{< ref path="/support/kb/synthetic-monitoring/api-monitoring/monitoring-web-services" lang="en" >}}) options under [API monitor types]({{< ref path="/support/kb/synthetic-monitoring/api-monitoring" lang="en" >}}), we've launched the newest Postman API monitor type  as its latest addition.

This feature allows you to maximize API checks by running a Postman workspace collection on the Uptrends checkpoint network. Test the behavior and performance of your APIs with the generated results.
