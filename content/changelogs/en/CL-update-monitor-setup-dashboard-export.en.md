We've now added the [load time and running time]({{< ref path="/support/kb/synthetic-monitoring/monitor-settings/error-conditions/load-time-limit-settings-alerts-and-warnings" lang="en" >}})  (error condition) details when you export your Monitor setup.

Exported files now include columns *"Alert on time limit 1"* and *"Alert on time limit 2"*, indicating whether these checks have only color-code results or generate an error status. Likewise, the columns *"Time limit 1"* and *"Time limit 2"* show your monitor's corresponding time thresholds.
