Operators can now specify which Uptrends newsletters they would like to receive. We have added a new section **Newsletter subscription** in the {{< AppElement type="tab" >}} Main {{< /AppElement >}} tab in the Operator settings. 

You can choose if you want to receive Feature updates or Checkpoint updates, or both, by selecting Subscribe. If you opted in or out of these Uptrends newsletters earlier, this new functionality will not affect your current subscription settings.
