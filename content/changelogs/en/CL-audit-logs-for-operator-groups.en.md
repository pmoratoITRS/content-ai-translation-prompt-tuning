We've expanded audit logging to include updates made from and to [operator groups]({{< ref path="/support/kb/account/users/operators/operator-groups" lang="en" >}}). We now record changes whenever you;
- Create a new operator group
- Delete an existing operator group
- Add or exclude members in an operator group
- Edit the name of an operator group
