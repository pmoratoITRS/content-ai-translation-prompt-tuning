We've introduced a new type of [Permission]({{< ref path="/support/kb/account/users/operators/permissions" lang="en" >}}): the **Operator permissions**. This permission type allows for control over who has visibility on which operators or operator groups. Also, it allows for [non-Administrator operators]({{< ref path="/support/kb/account/users/operators/giving-an-operator-administrator-rights" lang="en" >}}) to be given the permission to [add new operators]({{< ref path="/support/kb/account/users/operators/add-or-delete-operator" lang="en" >}}) to the account.

Note that by default, the *Everyone* operator group has the 'See operators' permission on the *Everyone* group, meaning that every operator in the account can see every other operator in the account. This permission can be removed in the settings of the *Everyone* operator group.
