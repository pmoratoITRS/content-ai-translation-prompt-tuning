If you are confronted with [errors]({{< ref path="support/kb/alerting/errors/unconfirmed-and-confirmed-errors" lang="en" >}}) that you regard to be incorrect, we offer the option to [clear errors]({{< ref path="support/kb/alerting/errors/clearing-errors" lang="en" >}}) and recalculate the [SLA (service level agreement)]({{< ref path="support/kb/dashboards-and-reporting/sla/setting-up-an-sla" lang="en" >}}) data for you.

Until now you had to create a (standard) Support ticket to request the error clearance and include the required information in writing. 
We've made that easier by adding a button {{< AppElement type="buttonSecondary" >}} Clear multiple errors {{< /AppElement >}} to the bottom of the monitor *Check details* dialog. 

Clicking the button will open a ticket specific to error clearance. In the ticket, you have to include the mandatory data to ensure that Support receives the info necessary to process your request. 
The mandatory information includes the monitor (groups) that are affected and the date range. Optionally you may fill in the checkpoints and status code.
