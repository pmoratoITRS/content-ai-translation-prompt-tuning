We are introducing [timeline screenshots]({{< ref path="support/kb/synthetic-monitoring/monitoring-results/timeline-screenshots" lang="en" >}}), also known as filmstrips, for transactions. This feature will be specifically tailored for [transactions with extra metrics]({{< ref path="support/kb/synthetic-monitoring/monitoring-results/extra-metrics-and-features" lang="en" >}}).   

The [filmstrip]({{< ref path="support/kb/synthetic-monitoring/transactions/understanding-the-step-editor" lang="en" >}}) checkbox will replace the existing screenshot checkbox. Transactions with screenshot actions will remain unchanged, and the screenshot action(s) will remain in place. The option to enable a step-action for a single screenshot will still be accessible via *Control* action **Screenshot**. Please note, filmstrips will cost one [transaction credit]({{< ref path="support/kb/synthetic-monitoring/transactions/Understanding-transaction-monitor-count-calculations" lang="en" >}}), unless there is already one screenshot in the step, in which case the filmstrip is free.
