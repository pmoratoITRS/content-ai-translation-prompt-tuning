Until now you had to be an administrator within the Uptrends app to be able to create, edit, and apply [monitor templates]({{< ref path="support/kb/synthetic-monitoring/monitor-management/monitor-templates" lang="en" >}}) because using monitor templates can have a big impact. On the other hand, you may want to give some operators the permission to use monitor templates without giving them access to other administrator rights. 

The solution is the newly added permission setting for monitor templates. This is a system-wide setting tied to operator groups or operators. Check out the instructions in the knowledge base article [Permissions]({{< ref path="support/kb/account/users/operators/permissions" lang="en" >}}) for granting or revoking permissions. Please note that only administrators have the right to change permissions.
