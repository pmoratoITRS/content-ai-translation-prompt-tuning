 To enable [two-factor authentication]({{< ref path="support/kb/account/settings/2fa-setup" lang="en" >}}), you can scan the QR code using your preferred authenticator app. If scanning isnâ€™t possible (for example, the preferred password manager does not support this feature), you can now switch to manual input by clicking the link below the code. A new panel will display the six-digit code and other data from the QR code, split into relevant parts.
