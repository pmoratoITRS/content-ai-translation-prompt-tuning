The **audit log** in your account now contains some additional information about the source of the change. Specifically, it will list if a change was made through the Uptrends web interface, or via the API. In case a change was made via the API, it will display [the specific API user]({{< ref path="/support/kb/api/authentication-v4" lang="en" >}}), in addition to the original operator.
