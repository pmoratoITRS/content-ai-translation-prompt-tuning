There is now a new [operator permission]({{< ref path="/support/kb/account/users/operators/permissions" lang="en" >}}): **Manage private locations**. Operators with this permission will be able to create new, or delete or manage existing [private locations]({{< ref path="/support/kb/synthetic-monitoring/checkpoints/private-locations" lang="en" >}}) in the account. Operators who are [Administrators]({{< ref path="/support/kb/account/users/operators/giving-an-operator-administrator-rights" lang="en" >}}) in the account will automatically have this permission.
