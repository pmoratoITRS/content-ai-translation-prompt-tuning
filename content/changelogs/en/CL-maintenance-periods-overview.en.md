Operators that have [Edit settings monitor permissions]({{< ref path="/support/kb/synthetic-monitoring/monitor-settings/monitor-permissions#permission-types" lang="en" >}}) for at least one monitor can now access the [Maintenance periods]({{< ref path="/support/kb/synthetic-monitoring/monitor-management/maintenance-periods" lang="en" >}}) overview page. Previously, only administrators had access to this page.

Operators can view, **Clean up**, or **Delete all** maintenance periods for the monitors they have **Edit settings** permissions for.
