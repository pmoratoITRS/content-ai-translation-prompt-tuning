To further customize your Uptrends alert email notifications, you can now use a wider range of variables in the email subject field:

- [Automatic variables]({{< ref path="/support/kb/synthetic-monitoring/transactions/automatic-variables" lang="en" >}})
- [Alert system variables]({{< ref path="/support/kb/alerting/integrations/custom-integrations/alerting-system-variables" lang="en" >}})

Previously, the automatic variable `{{@monitor.name}}` was only supported for single and multiple monitors. Now, this expanded functionality makes it easier to categorize and track the status of your monitors via email.

For more information, refer to the [Customizing the alert email subject]({{< ref path="/support/kb/alerting/customize-alert-email-subject" lang="en" >}}) knowledge base article.
