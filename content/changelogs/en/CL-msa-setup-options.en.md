Creating [Multi-step API monitors]({{< ref path="/support/kb/synthetic-monitoring/api-monitoring/multi-step" lang="en" >}}) is now more flexible and user-friendly. You now have the option to jumpstart your setup with a ready-made, fully functional example that you can modify and test right away. If you prefer using the default configuration, you still have the flexibility to build your monitor from scratch.

Whether you're starting fresh or using a template, these options make it easier to set up monitoring customized to your specific needs.
