The `@‌alert.sslValidUntil` system variable contains the date and time when the SSL certificate is set to expire for SSL monitor alerts. You can now see this value when receiving an OK alert type instead of showing an empty string. Refer to the [Alerting system variables page]({{< ref path="/support/kb/alerting/integrations/custom-integrations/alerting-system-variables" lang="en" >}}) to know more.
