Users can now better protect their Uptrends accounts by applying [two-factor authentication (2FA)]({{< ref path="/support/kb/account/settings/2fa-setup" lang="en" >}}) to their operator accounts. Uptrends supports time-based one-time password (TOTP) two-factor authentication, meaning users can easily configure their login options by scanning a QR code with any authenticator app of their choice. 

Account administrators can enforce the use of 2FA account wide, or for each operator in the account individually. After setup, operators will be prompted to enter a six-digit code generated by their authenticator app in addition to their user credentials when logging into Uptrends.
