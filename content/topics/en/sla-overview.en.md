An SLA (or service level agreement) is a contract between providers of a service and its users, outlining the minimum level of acceptable service delivered. For example, if you wanted to host a website with a web hosting provider, oftentimes the web hosting company will tell you that they guarantee a certain percentage of uptime as part of their SLA. With Uptrends, you can monitor your SLA with a website, server, or web application provider or monitor an SLA you provide to your customers.

Check out the instructions in [Setting up an SLA]({{< ref path="support/kb/dashboards-and-reporting/sla/setting-up-an-sla" lang="en" >}}) to get started on creating your SLA definition in Uptrends. You may create several SLA definitions, please see the knowledge base article [Working with muliple SLA definitions]({{< ref path="support/kb/dashboards-and-reporting/sla/working-with-multiple-SLA-definitions" lang="en" >}}) to find out how you have to implement this.

The data gathered for your SLAs can be viewed on the *SLA overview* dashboard or it can be exported (as download or sent by email). This and how to recalculate data, if needed, is explained in the article [Working with SLA data and reports]({{< ref path="support/kb/dashboards-and-reporting/sla/working-with-sla-data-and-reports" lang="en" >}}).

Last but not least, if things don't appear as you would expect them to, check out [Missing SLA overview data]({{< ref path="support/kb/dashboards-and-reporting/sla/missing-sla-overview-data" lang="en" >}}) to get some hints on what might be wrong here.
