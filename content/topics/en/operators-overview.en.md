First you need to know where and how to add new operators (or operator groups) in general. Check out our KB article [Add or delete an operator]({{< ref path="/support/kb/account/users/operators/add-or-delete-operator" lang="en" >}}) to get started with the basics.

When you have added a new operator you'll reach the operator settings page which has several tabs for the configuration of the user account. Check out the following knowledge base articles to find out about the related operator tab settings.

{{< AppElement type="tab" >}} Main {{< /AppElement >}} — contact details, login info, and personal settings like the default dashboard or timezone are explained in the knowledge base article [Main settings]({{< ref path="/support/kb/account/users/operators/main-settings" lang="en" >}}).

{{< AppElement type="tab" >}} Off-duty schedules {{< /AppElement >}} — off-duty schedules for operators are discussed in [Duty schedules]({{< ref path="/support/kb/account/users/operators/using-duty-schedules" lang="en" >}}).

{{< AppElement type="tab" >}} Member of {{< /AppElement >}} — you can find background info in [Operator groups]({{< ref path="/support/kb/account/users/operators/operator-groups" lang="en" >}}) and [Operator admin rights]({{< ref path="/support/kb/account/users/operators/giving-an-operator-administrator-rights" lang="en" >}}).

{{< AppElement type="tab" >}} Permissions {{< /AppElement >}} — holds the configuration of who will be able to access what, which is explained in the article [Permissions]({{< ref path="/support/kb/account/users/operators/permissions" lang="en" >}}).

{{< AppElement type="tab" >}} API management {{< /AppElement >}} - lets you add API accounts/credentials to an operator which are needed to make calls using [Uptrends' API]({{< ref path="support/kb/api" lang="en" >}}). Follow the instructions in [Operator API management]({{< ref path="support/kb/account/users/operators/operator-API-management" lang="en" >}}) to add or remove API accounts.

Within the Uptrends application, you can find the [User management hub]({{< ref path="/support/kb/account/users/operators/user-management-hub" lang="en" >}}) for a quick and easy overview of the operators in your account.
