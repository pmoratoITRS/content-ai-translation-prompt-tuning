Synthetic monitoring means actively and continuously testing your website or web service for availability, performance, and function. As there are many different things to monitor, Uptrends offers several different [monitor types]({{< ref path="support/kb/basics/monitor-types" lang="en" >}}) with different set-up options.

Uptrends uses credits to calculate the pricing for different monitoring services. For more information, refer to the [credits]({{< ref path="/support/kb/account/payments-and-subscriptions/adding-extra-monitors-and-sms" lang="en" >}}) knowledge base article.
