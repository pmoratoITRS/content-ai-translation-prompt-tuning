The Uptrends account is the main account for the Uptrends app that you get when starting a trial or buying a subscription plan. The subscriber who holds this account has administrator privileges in the Uptrends app and can give other people access to the Uptrends account. These users are called operators. They can have different access rights (based on their role or responsibilities) which are handled through permissions.

You can access the account setting by going to the menu {{< AppElement type="menuitem" >}} Account setup {{< /AppElement >}}. Read the knowledge base articles listed below for further information on a number of topics related to the Uptrends account.
