You need a subscription to use the Uptrends app (after a 30-day trial period). Please see the [pricing overview]({{< ref path="pricing" lang="en" >}}) for more information on the available subscription plans.
Once you have a subscribed to a plan, you can handle many things related to your subscription yourself, like [Adding extra monitors and credits]({{< ref path="support/kb/account/payments-and-subscriptions/adding-extra-monitors-and-sms" lang="en" >}}), renewing your subscription (in the app go to {{< AppElement type="menuitem" >}} Account setup > Renew {{< /AppElement >}}) or checking the actual subscription and invoices (in the app open {{< AppElement type="menuitem" >}} Account setup > Subscription and invoices {{< /AppElement >}}).

If you have questions about your account that are not covered in the knowledge base articles, please contact [Support]({{< ref path="contact" lang="en" >}}) by entering a ticket.
