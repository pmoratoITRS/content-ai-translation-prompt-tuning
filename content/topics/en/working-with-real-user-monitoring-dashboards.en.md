There are two great RUM (real user monitoring) dashboards already set up for you. In this article, we will show you the highlights of these predefined dashboards. You can also make your own [custom dashboards]({{< ref path="support/kb/dashboards-and-reporting/dashboards/custom-dashboards" lang="en" >}}) to adjust the view of data to your needs.

## The RUM overview dashboard

The Overview dashboard tells you all about your site's page visits, visitors, and their experiences based on their location, device, operating system, and browser.

### The maps

Your interactive RUM maps show you where your page views originate and the locations of your best and worst performing user experiences. The deeper the color, the higher the page views or the load times. Clicking on the country opens a performance dashboard based on the country.

### Data tables

The data tables break your data down into the individual user environment variables. If an entry has a magnifying glass icon, there is additional data about the operating system, browser versions, or there is data based on state or province. Just click the icon to see the details.

## RUM performance dashboard

The RUM performance dashboard contains your all important metrics such as time to first byte and page ready time.  Detailed information is displayed about load times, network durations, backend durations, frontend durations, and total download time. The performance dashboard displays the data in convenient tables and graphs.
