If you've chosen to have our scriptwriters write and test your web application monitoring scripts, please be aware that our transaction scriptwriters make every attempt to review your transaction recordings and get your scripts set up as fast as possible. To assist with keeping the scripts moving for everyone, we ask that you observe the following guidelines and restrictions in regards to submitting your transaction recordings for review.

**Trial customers**: We want you to have the best experience possible when trying out our Web Application Monitoring. Please feel free to make as many recordings as you would like to edit and test using the Uptrends application. However, you may only submit **one recording** for scripting and stabilization by our support team during your trial period.

**Paid customers**: We want to accommodate everyone as quickly as possible. To prevent any one customer from monopolizing the time of our scriptwriters, we limit paid accounts to have no more than **three recordings up for review simultaneously**.

We appreciate everyone's patience and understanding of why we need these guidelines, but we also know that sometimes you have perfectly good reasons why we need to make exceptions. Please work with your [monitoring consultant](/contact) to help us find a solution that works for you while taking the needs of others into consideration.
