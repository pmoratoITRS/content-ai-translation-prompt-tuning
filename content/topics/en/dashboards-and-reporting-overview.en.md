When monitoring your servers or services lots of data is collected about their performance. You have several options to work with this data.

Probably the most popular and straightforward way to view your data is on [dashboards]({{< ref path="support/kb/dashboards-and-reporting/dashboards" lang="en" >}}). There are some [preconfigured dashboards]({{< ref path="support/kb/dashboards-and-reporting/dashboards/predefined-dashboards" lang="en" >}}) but you can also create user-defined dashboards with the [dashboard tiles]({{< ref path="support/kb/dashboards-and-reporting/dashboards/custom-report-tiles" lang="en" >}}) that best fit your needs.

A special preconfigured dashboard that should be mentioned is the [*SLA overview*]({{< ref path="support/kb/dashboards-and-reporting/sla/working-with-sla-data-and-reports" lang="en" >}}) dashboard which you can reach by navigation to {{< AppElement type="menuitem" >}} Dashboards > Synthetics > SLA overview {{< /AppElement >}}. It provides an overview of all statistics for the [SLAs (service level agreements)]({{< ref path="support/kb/dashboards-and-reporting/sla/setting-up-an-sla" lang="en" >}}) that you have configured.

If you want to show your data externally (outside your Uptrends account), you may use [public status pages]({{< ref path="support/kb/dashboards-and-reporting/status-pages/public-and-protected-status-pages" lang="en" >}}) which are a specific kind of dashboards designed for publishing data.

In addition to viewing data on dashboards, you can also [export the data]({{< ref path="support/kb/dashboards-and-reporting/dashboards/exporting-dashboard-data" lang="en" >}}) as reports in PDF or XLS format, and even schedule these reports to be mailed.

Are you working with Grafana to visualize your data? Uptrends offers an [integration with Grafana]({{< ref path="support/kb/dashboards-and-reporting/grafana" lang="en" >}}) to easily show Uptrends data in a Grafana environment.
