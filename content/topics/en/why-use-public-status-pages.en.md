Uptrends public status pages are used for a variety of things, including: communicating with customers, sharing uptime data, and building public trust.

#### Open Communication

When a website goes down, it can affect a lot of people who have grown to trust and depend on it being available.

Displaying the health and operation status of your site for everyone to see can minimize the frustration that arises from website downtime. It shows that you understand that people depend on your site, and that you are doing everything you can to return it to full operation.

#### Data Sharing

People typically don’t like feeling left in the dark, or being the last to know when something bad happens that could affect them.

Public status pages make it easy for you to divulge critical data in a simple, easy-to-share format, so your users and team members can stay “in the know,” 24/7.

#### Trust Building

Open communication and the easy sharing of data are the two primary uses of public status pages, but it is important to mention what they combine to do: build trust.

Current and prospective customers want to know that you’re working hard for them, trying to deliver the best experience possible. By publicly displaying your website uptime status, you’re making a powerful statement - you’re confident in your website uptime potential, and you want people to know about it.
