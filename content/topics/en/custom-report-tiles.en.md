Uptrends offers a wide variety of report tiles suitable for all your monitoring needs. These report tiles conveniently show the metrics of your monitors, checkpoints, and error status through diagrams. As part of your [dashboard settings]({{< ref path="/support/kb/dashboards-and-reporting/dashboards" lang="en" >}}), these tiles include different types, ranging from a tabular list of information, line graphs, bar graphs, and pie charts.

To start, [add a report tile]({{< ref path="/support/kb/dashboards-and-reporting/dashboards/custom-report-tiles-add" lang="en" >}}) to your default Uptrends dashboards or create your setup from scratch. Once added, click the {{< AppElement type="iconTileSettings" >}} {{< /AppElement >}} icon to access the tile settings and customize the configuration.

This knowledge base article walks you through the different report tile types and their settings.

## Simple data list or chart {id="simple-data-list-chart"}

This report tile type allows you to select monitors or monitor groups to display metrics from the **General**, **Core Web Vitals**, and **W3C navigation** options. These metrics may vary depending on the monitor type and other configuration settings. For more information, refer to [Core Web Vitals]({{< ref path="/support/kb/synthetic-monitoring/monitoring-results/core-web-vitals" lang="en" >}}) and [W3C navigation]({{< ref path="/support/kb/synthetic-monitoring/monitoring-results/w3c-navigation-timings" lang="en" >}})


For Transaction monitors, ensure that youâ€™ve enabled the [Performance metrics]({{< ref path="/support/kb/synthetic-monitoring/transactions/understanding-the-step-editor#step-settings" lang="en" >}}) in the **Waterfall** settings of your transaction step settings. Expect that the period before this change will not reflect any **Core Web Vitals** and **W3C navigation metrics** data. You can adjust the report period in the tile settings to only show the range from which the metrics were enabled.

Once configured, the Simple data list or chart will show a graph corresponding to the metrics. Check the legend and hover over the graph for more information about the steps. To learn more about related metrics, refer to the [Calculation of uptime and downtime]({{< ref path="/support/kb/dashboards-and-reporting/dashboards/calculation-of-uptime-and-downtime" lang="en" >}}) knowledge base article.
