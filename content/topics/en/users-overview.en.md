[Operators]({{< ref path="support/kb/account/users/operators" lang="en" >}}) are the user accounts in the Uptrends app. They are managed by an administrator and each operator belongs to at least one [operator group]({{< ref path="/support/kb/account/users/operators/operator-groups" lang="en" >}}). Operators have their own login credentials unless they are using single sign-on as only login option. The administrator has access to all settings for the operator and the operator may adjust a few of them, e.g. the language, timezone or default dashboard, to their preference.
