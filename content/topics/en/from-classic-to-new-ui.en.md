The user interface (UI) of the Uptrends app has been out there for quite some years and it was time for a change. 

One of the goals of the new UI is the integration of Uptrends' products Synthetics, RUM and Infra within the same Uptrends app. This becomes obvious in the new side menu and the new dashboard "360-degree overview", which shows information from the various products. In addition, the UI got an overall fresher look and hubs were added that present related information in one place. 

This article will help you to find your way in the new UI of the Uptrends app. Many things have changed, but may not affect the way you work. For example, the dashboards have been restyled for a fresh look. This looks different, but you still find the things you need in the well-known places.

The menu is a different story. It has been totally reworked, positions of menus and even some names have changed. Uptrends recommends checking the [Classic vs new menu](#classic-vs-new-menu) comparison table and the [Menu](#menu) section to learn more about the changes.

## Classic vs new menu {id="classic-vs-new-menu"}

The table below shows how the classic menu maps to the new menu.
