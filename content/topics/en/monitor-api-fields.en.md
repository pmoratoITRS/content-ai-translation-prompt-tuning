This article describes the API fields that are relevant for working with the [Monitor API](/support/kb/api/monitor-api).

The definition of a Monitor object contains many fields. Some fields apply to all monitors (e.g. the MonitorGuid, Name, CheckInterval, and so on.). However, since different types of monitors require different settings, many fields are only relevant for specific monitor types.

## Generic monitor fields

| Field name                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `MonitorGuid`               | The monitor’s unique ID. This value is returned when you retrieve an existing monitor using GET, or when you create a new one using POST. This field must be omitted in your request body when using POST. It may be specified in PUT or PATCH requests, but it must match the monitorGuid specified in the URL of your API call.                                                                   |
| `Name`                      | The name of the monitor. Please take care to use a name that isn’t empty, and doesn’t already exist in your account.                                                                                                |
| `MonitorType`               | The monitor type. Once a monitor is created, the type may not be changed. Possible values are `Http`, `Https`, `Connect`, `Ping`, `POP3`, `SMTP`, `FTP`, `MySQL`, `MSSQL`, `WebserviceHttp`, `WebserviceHttps`, `Transaction`, `DNS`, `FullPageCheck`, `Certificate`, `SFTP`, `MultiStepApi`, `IMAP`, and `Postman`. Note that the availability of monitor types depends on your pricing plan. |
| `GenerateAlert`             | `True` or `False`. When set to false, no alerts will be generated for this monitor in case of an error.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `IsActive`                  | `True` or `False`. Indicates whether the monitor is actively running in the account. The value cannot be set to `True` when `MonitorMode` is set to `Development`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `IsLocked`                  | `True` or `False`, and a read-only field. It specifies whether the monitor is currently *locked for editing*. This happens if the Support team is reviewing your monitor. If you’re including this field in a POST request, you must specify the value False. If you’re including this field in a PUT or PATCH request, you may only specify the current value for this monitor.                    |

| `Custom fields`             | Refers to the custom data set in the main settings of your monitor.                    |
| `SelectedCheckpoints`       | The checkpoint regions or individual checkpoints where this monitor will be executed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `CheckInterval`             | Numeric value for the time interval between individual checks, in minutes. The maximum value is 240 (4 hours). The minimum value depends on the type of monitor. For Full Page Checks and Transactions, the minimum is typically 5.                                                                                                                                            |
| `MonitorMode`               | {{< tableformatter >}} The monitor mode, either `Development`, `Staging` or `Production`. See [this article](/support/kb/synthetic-monitoring/monitor-settings/monitor-mode) for more information.  {{< /tableformatter >}} |
| `Notes`                     | Your notes for this monitor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `UsePrimaryCheckpointsOnly` | {{< tableformatter >}} `True` or `False`. The recommended value is True. Only set this to False when you’re sure you want to execute your monitor on non-primary checkpoints. See [this article](/support/kb/synthetic-monitoring/checkpoints/non-primary-checkpoints) for more information.  {{< /tableformatter >}} |
| `NameForPhoneAlerts`        | {{< tableformatter >}} 

The value for the [speech-friendly monitor name](/support/kb/alerting/speech-friendly-monitor-names-for-phone-alerts), if applicable. This is the monitor name we'll use in text-to-speech phone alerting, provided that the 'Use alternate monitor names' option has been enabled in the phone alert integration. If not, this field will not be available through the API.  {{< /tableformatter >}} |

## Fields for specific monitor types

As each monitor type has a different purpose, different types of monitors require their own settings. The following table shows the other available fields for different monitor types. Please note that the documentation for these fields is growing. If you’re not sure about a particular field, please review the corresponding settings in the Uptrends application itself, or refer to the [Uptrends API v4 documentation](https://api.uptrends.com/v4/swagger/index.html).

| Field name           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `IpVersion`          | `IpV4` or `IpV6`. Indicates which IP version should be used to connect to the server or network address you specify. If you choose IPv6, the monitor will only be executed on checkpoint locations that support IPv6.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
| `NetworkAddress`     | The network address that should be used to connect to the server or service you want to monitor. When you specify a host name (e.g. `server.your-domain.com`), that host name will be resolved during a monitor check on the checkpoint server that performs the check, using the DNS settings that are available on that location. Alternatively, specify an IPv4 or IPv6 address. If you want to specify a specific port number (when appropriate), please use the Port field. Port numbers should not be included in the NetworkAddress field.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `Port`               | The TCP port number that should be used to establish a connection to the host name or IP address you specified.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `Url`                | The full URL of the appropriate website, page or service that you want to monitor. The URL should include "http://" or "https://". If relevant, please also include a port number if you are using a non-default port number, e.g. `https://your-domain.com:8080/your-page`. You can also use a fixed IP address as part of the URL instead of a host name, if your server listens to incoming requests without a host name.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `UserAgent`          | A string value that identifies which HTTP client is making the HTTP request. A browser typically sends a value that identifies the browser type and version. For example, a Chrome browser might send `Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/67.0.3396.79 Safari/537.36`. You can fill in any text you like, as long as your web server accepts it as a valid user agent. Many websites and APIs don’t care about it, but some are very particular about it. For FPC and Transaction monitors: if you leave this value empty, the *native* user agent will be sent, i.e. the useragent value that is produced by the actual browser that is used to execute the monitor. |
| `AuthenticationType` | The type of HTTP authentication that should be used to send authentication data along with the outgoing request. For HTTP(S) and Webservice HTTP(S) monitors, for SSL certificate checks and for authentication inside a Multi-step API step, the following values are available: `None`, `Basic`, `NTLM`, `Digest`. For FPC and Transaction monitors, choose either `None` or `Basic`. This field does not apply to any other monitor types.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `Username`           | For monitor types that support HTTP authentication (see the `AuthenticationType` field), specify the username of the appropriate credentials here. Other monitor types, including SFTP, FTP, SMTP, POP3, IMAP, SQL Server and MySQL also support authentication for the appropriate protocol.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
