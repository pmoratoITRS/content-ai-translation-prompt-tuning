Getting instant alerts when an error or downtime occurs is great, but there are times when you just don’t want to get them. To learn about how to temporarily pause alerts in Uptrends, read on…

## How to Pause Alerts

It is possible to temporarily pause any or all alerts within your Uptrends account, using **1** of **2 ways**: the *All-Stop*; which pauses all alerts in one click via the Account Overview Dashboard; and via your individual *monitor settings*.

You can also choose to [set up a maintenance schedule]({{< ref path="/support/kb/synthetic-monitoring/monitor-management/maintenance-periods" lang="en" >}}) if you’re looking to pause alerts on a scheduled basis.

## Via an All-Stop

If you’re looking to quickly pause all of your alerts in one go…

1.  Log into your Uptrends account and hover over the {{< AppElement type="menuitem" >}}Account Status – All Monitors{{< /AppElement >}} tile in the **Account Overview Dashboard**.
2.  You will then see a red button appear, offering you to {{< AppElement type="button" >}}Stop All Alerts{{< /AppElement >}}. Click it, and accept the prompt, to pause all alerts.
3.  To re-activate alerts, hover over the tile again, and click the green {{< AppElement type="savebutton" >}}Start All Alerts{{< /AppElement >}} button to (you guessed it) restart all alerts.
