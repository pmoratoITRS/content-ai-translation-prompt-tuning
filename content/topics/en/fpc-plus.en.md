The standard FPC does monitor your third-party elements like plugins for social media and advertising. However, to be able to report on those elements you must select an enhanced FPC, to get a Full Page Check Plus (FPC\+) monitor.

You may have noticed, that you can't pick *Full Page Check Plus* from the **Browser type** box when creating a monitor. The FPC\+ is an FPC monitor with one differenceâ€”the **Upgrade to enhanced FPC** check box is selected in the **Details** section on the {{< AppElement type="tab" >}}Main{{< /AppElement >}} tab for the monitor.

This choice tells Uptrends that you want to retrieve and track your third-party elements, to enable you to quickly identify the source for your element types using domain groups. For information about understanding and setting up your domain groups, see [Working with domain groups](/support/kb/synthetic-monitoring/browser-monitoring/working-with-domain-groups).
