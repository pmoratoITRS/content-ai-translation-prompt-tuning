So you’ve forgotten your account password – whoops! **But don’t panic!** We’ve made it easy for you to securely recover your password in the event that something like this happened.

## How to recover your password

To recover your password you can click on the {{< AppElement type="menuitem" >}}Lost Password{{< /AppElement >}} link on the Uptrends login screen, or you can click the following link and [go straight to the password recovery page]({{< AppUrl >}}/Account/LostPassword?lang=en).

Once you’re there, you will need to input your **Account ID** number (*if you’re an account administrator*), or your **operator account e-mail address** (*if you’re an operator on an account*).

An email containing a **temporary password** will be sent to your e-mail inbox.
