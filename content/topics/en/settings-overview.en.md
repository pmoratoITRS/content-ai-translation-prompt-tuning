Your Uptrends account is the central place for managing users ([operators]({{< ref path="support/kb/account/users/operators" lang="en" >}})), checking [payments and subscriptions]({{< ref path="support/kb/account/payments-and-subscriptions" lang="en" >}}), invoices, and maintaining general settings.

Go to {{< AppElement type="menuitem" >}} Account setup > Account settings {{< /AppElement >}}. On the {{< AppElement type="tab" >}} Settings {{< /AppElement >}} tab you'll find a number of general settings like the [time zone]({{< ref path="support/kb/account/settings/timezones" lang="en" >}}), language, default dashboard to show, and login options like [single sign-on]({{< ref path="support/kb/account/settings/single-sign-on-overview" lang="en" >}}) and [two-factor authentication]({{< ref path="support/kb/account/settings/2fa-setup" lang="en" >}}). Note that the settings here are the default for the whole Uptrends account and apply to all users. However, several settings can be changed individually by the user, e.g. each user may set their own language.
