Monitors are at the heart of the Uptrends app. They are the place where you define which server, web service or website you want to monitor.

Check out the article [Adding monitors]({{< ref path="support/kb/basics/adding-monitors" lang="en" >}}) and the knowledge base chapter [Monitor settings]({{< ref path="support/kb/synthetic-monitoring/monitor-settings" lang="en" >}}) for information on the setup of monitors.

Once you've set up some monitors you may need the following features to manage your growing pool of monitors:

- Organize your monitors in [Monitor groups]({{< ref path="support/kb/synthetic-monitoring/monitor-management/monitor-groups" lang="en" >}})
- Quickly update a number of settings with [Monitor templates]({{< ref path="support/kb/synthetic-monitoring/monitor-management/monitor-templates" lang="en" >}})
