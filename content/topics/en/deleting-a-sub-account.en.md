Deleting a sub account is pretty straightforward; you remove the operators and then delete the sub account. However, we've got a few tips for you that will make deleting sub accounts and sub-account operators a little easier, especially if you manage several sub accounts.

## Delete a sub account

 We recommend that you delete the sub account operators before deleting the sub account. Why? While the sub account is active, you can easily identify the operators of a given sub account on the {{< AppElement type="menuitem" >}}Operators{{< /AppElement >}} page.

1. Open the operator hub by going to ({{< AppElement type="menuitem" >}}Account setup > Operators, groups and sub accounts{{< /AppElement >}}).
2. Open the sub account settings page by clicking the {{< AppElement type="buttonPrimary" >}} View all sub accounts {{< /AppElement >}} button.
3. Click on the sub account you want to delete.
2. Navigate to the {{< AppElement type="tab" >}}Operators{{< /AppElement >}} tab.
4. Delete the operators (see [Sub account operator management]({{< ref path="support/kb/account/users/sub-accounts/sub-account-operator-management" lang="en" >}}) for operator deletion instructions). The **Member of groups** column will help you identify the sub account operators.
5. Navigate to {{< AppElement type="menuitem" >}}Account setup > Monitor groups{{< /AppElement >}}.
6. Click to open the monitor group for the sub account.
7. Click {{< AppElement type="deletebutton" >}}Delete this monitor group{{< /AppElement >}}.
8. Go back to the sub account's settings page.
9. Click {{< AppElement type="deletebutton" >}}Delete this sub account{{< /AppElement >}}.

**Note**: Just removing the operators from the sub account without deleting them gives the orphaned sub-account operators access to a read-only view of the primary account. Following the procedure outlined above helps you to avoid orphaned sub-account operators.
