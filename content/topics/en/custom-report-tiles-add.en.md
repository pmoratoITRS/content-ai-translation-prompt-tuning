To add a report tile to a custom dashboard:

1. (Optional) If your custom dashboard is not open yet, go to {{< AppElement type="menuitem" >}}Dashboards > Custom dashboards{{< /AppElement >}} and click on your dashboard's name.

2. If you want to add a new tile to your dashboard, go to the hamburger menu {{< AppElement type="iconFeather" >}}{{< /AppElement >}} at the top right of the dashboard and select {{< AppElement type="menuitem" >}}Add tile{{< /AppElement >}}. 

3. If your dashboard has empty tiles (placeholders) that you want to configure, click on any given tile marked **Click to display data here**.

    If you need help choosing the tile type, we recommend reading the knowledge base article [Custom report tiles]({{< ref path="support/kb/dashboards-and-reporting/dashboards/custom-report-tiles" lang="en" >}}).
5. Select the monitor(s) or monitor group(s) that you wish to view data for within the tile. You can always change this later. 
    When you have selected the appropriate monitor(s), click {{< AppElement type="editbutton" >}}Finish{{< /AppElement >}}.

The tile content is now displayed. You can continue filling out the rest of your dashboard tiles or add new ones by repeating the steps above. Whenever you make any changes to individual tiles or the dashboard, be sure to save them using the {{< AppElement type="savebutton" >}}Save{{< /AppElement >}} button above your dashboard.

**Note**: For newly created or modified monitors, the dashboard tile reflects the monitor data within 2 seconds. Once any initial data appears on the tile or five minutes have passed, the tile refreshes and retrieves data every 30 seconds, following the standard loading time.
