We've updated our terminology to improve clarity when referring to what you buy in our platform. What was previously called a *monitor* is now referred to as a *credit*:

- **Basic monitors** is now **Uptime credits**
- **API monitoring credits** is now **API credits**
- **Browser monitors** is now **Browser credits**
- **Monitors** is now **credits** â€” only applies to all existing accounts using single buckets
