 To enable [two-factor authentication]([LINK_URL_1]), you can scan the QR code using your preferred authenticator app. If scanning isnâ€™t possible (for example, the preferred password manager does not support this feature), you can now switch to manual input by clicking the link below the code. A new panel will display the six-digit code and other data from the QR code, split into relevant parts.
