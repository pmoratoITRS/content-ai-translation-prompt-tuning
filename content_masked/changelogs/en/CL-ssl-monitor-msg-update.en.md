We've now included the remaining days before your SSL certificate expires in the error descriptions of SSL monitors. You can now see specific alert messages under SSL monitors > *Monitor logs* and *Alert logs* dashboard;

- *SSL certificate will expire in 1 day*
- *SSL certificate will expire in less than 1 day*
- *SSL certificate will expire in **x** days*

Likewise, the generic SSL error message: *"SSL certificate will expire soon"* can still be found in the *Errors overview* dashboard or in places where errors are grouped together. Explore the [SSL certificate knowledge base article]([LINK_URL_1]) to know more!
