[SSL certificate monitors]([LINK_URL_1]) can be used to check the validity of your SSL certificate. Additionally, they can be configured to generate errors when the checked certificate is due to expire in a configurable number of days. The monitor check result for SSL certificate monitors has now been expanded to also include the date the certificate is due to expire.
