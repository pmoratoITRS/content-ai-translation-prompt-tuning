We are introducing [timeline screenshots]([LINK_URL_1]), also known as filmstrips, for transactions. This feature will be specifically tailored for [transactions with extra metrics]([LINK_URL_2]).   

The [filmstrip]([LINK_URL_3]) checkbox will replace the existing screenshot checkbox. Transactions with screenshot actions will remain unchanged, and the screenshot action(s) will remain in place. The option to enable a step-action for a single screenshot will still be accessible via *Control* action **Screenshot**. Please note, filmstrips will cost one [transaction credit]([LINK_URL_4]), unless there is already one screenshot in the step, in which case the filmstrip is free.
