It is now possible to enable HTML formatting for alerting emails. You can change the outgoing email format of alerting emails to HTML, which will show a basic formatted email and replace plain text links with text with a hyperlink. 

To format outgoing alerting emails with HTML, go to the Alerting by email integration in the menu under [SHORTCODE_1] Alerting > Integrations [SHORTCODE_2], select the Customize integration box, go to the [SHORTCODE_3] Customizations [SHORTCODE_4] tab, and select *Use HTML mail*.

Changing from plain text to HTML formatting in alert emails may cause issues with automated systems that use the plain text alerting emails. As a result, this option is not enabled by default for existing accounts, but it is enabled by default for new accounts.
