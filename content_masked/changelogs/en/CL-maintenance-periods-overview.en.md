Operators that have [Edit settings monitor permissions]([LINK_URL_1]) for at least one monitor can now access the [Maintenance periods]([LINK_URL_2]) overview page. Previously, only administrators had access to this page.

Operators can view, **Clean up**, or **Delete all** maintenance periods for the monitors they have **Edit settings** permissions for.
