Along with the current [Multi-step API]([LINK_URL_1]), [Webservice Http and Webservice Https]([LINK_URL_2]) options under [API monitor types]([LINK_URL_3]), we've launched the newest Postman API monitor type  as its latest addition.

This feature allows you to maximize API checks by running a Postman workspace collection on the Uptrends checkpoint network. Test the behavior and performance of your APIs with the generated results.
