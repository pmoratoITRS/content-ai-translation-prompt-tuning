The IP address [INLINE_CODE_1] has been added to the email integration whitelist. Please ensure this IP is included in your own whitelist to allow email requests from it. Note that the new IP is gradually being rolled out for all outgoing emails from the Uptrends platform, with full implementation expected in the coming weeks.
