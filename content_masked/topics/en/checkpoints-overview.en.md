Uptrends features a vast network of over {{% Features/Variable variable="CheckpointCount" %}} global monitoring [checkpoints]([LINK_URL_1]) that you can configure to monitor your websites, servers, and web services to determine the origin of an issue.

There are cases where you want to host your monitoring activities internally, making them inaccessible from the public internet. In such cases, Uptrends gives you the option to set up a Docker-based [private location]([LINK_URL_2]) inside your own network to run and manage your own checkpoints for internal monitoring.
