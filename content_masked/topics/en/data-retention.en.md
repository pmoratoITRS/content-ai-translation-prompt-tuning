Collecting large quantities of data is essential to maximizing your website, server, and web application potential, but all that collection is for naught if you can't retain data over time.

The products Uptrends Synthetics, Uptrends Real User Monitoring, and Uptrends Infra collect different types of data. Uptrends offers long-term data retention for paid subscription plans so that you can get the most out of your monitoring data.
