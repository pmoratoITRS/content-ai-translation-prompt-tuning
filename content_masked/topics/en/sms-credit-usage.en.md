2.  Go to [SHORTCODE_1]Account[SHORTCODE_2] and select [SHORTCODE_3]Subscription Status[SHORTCODE_4] underneath [SHORTCODE_5]Subscription[SHORTCODE_6] in the menu.
3.  On the [SHORTCODE_7]Subscription[SHORTCODE_8] you can see the remaining message credits.

Or, hit this link directly: [HTML_TAG_1]}}/Report/SmsUsage>.

## How will you notify me if I start to run out of message credits?

We will send (free) warning messages via SMS and e-mail to all administrators in your account. This happens when you are down to 25 remaining credits.
