At Uptrends, we believe that everything is better when you do it as a team. That’s why we’ve made it easy to incorporate every member of your team, with individual operator accounts. But what if you want to give operators specific permissions?

## How to give an operator admin rights

If an **operator** is a member of the *Administrators* operator group, that operator will automatically have administrator rights. If they are not currently a member of that operator group, but you’d like them to be, please do as follows:

1.  Log into your Uptrends account.  
2.  Go to [SHORTCODE_1]Account setup > Operator groups[SHORTCODE_2].

    A list of existing operator groups will be shown.
3.  Select the group *Administrators* from the list.  

    You will see which individual operators currently belong to the Administrators group. In the group *Everyone* you find the full list of operators in your Uptrends account.

4.  To add an operator (or multiple), click on the checkboxes next to their name.  
5.  When you’re done, click [SHORTCODE_3]Save[SHORTCODE_4].

That’s it! To learn more about operators and operator groups, please check out the [Operators]([LINK_URL_2]) chapter in the knowledge base.
