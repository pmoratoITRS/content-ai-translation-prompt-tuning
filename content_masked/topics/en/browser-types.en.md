You can configure a Full Page Check (FPC) to use one of several available browsers. The **Browser type** setting can be found in both the [SHORTCODE_3] Main [SHORTCODE_4] and [SHORTCODE_5] Advanced [SHORTCODE_6] tabs of the monitor settings. The following browsers are available:

- Chrome
- Microsoft Edge

Uptrends keeps the browsers up to date on the [checkpoints]([LINK_URL_1]), so your check will typically be executed in the latest version available for the selected browser.

**Note:** If you want to monitor how your website behaves on a mobile device, you have to adjust the [user agent]([LINK_URL_2]) on the monitor's [SHORTCODE_7] Advanced [SHORTCODE_8] tab.
