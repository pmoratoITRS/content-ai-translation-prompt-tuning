The Uptrends **Integrations** feature allows you to receive [alerts]([LINK_URL_1]) and notifications whenever errors are detected in your monitors. You can define various integrations, including default integrations, third-party or external integrations, and custom integrations.

Uptrends offers default integrations, such as [phone (voice)]([LINK_URL_2]), SMS, and email. There are also integrations connected to third-party systems like [Slack]([LINK_URL_3]) or [Microsoft Teams]([LINK_URL_4]), as well as custom integrations that you can build using a template or completely from scratch.

For more information about integrations, refer to the knowledge base articles [What are integrations?]([LINK_URL_5]) and [Supported Integrations in Uptrends]([LINK_URL_6]).
