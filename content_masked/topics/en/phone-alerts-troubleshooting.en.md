## I'm not receiving my alert phone calls

When you're not receiving phone calls, please verify the following things:

1.  Is your country available in the list of **supported countries** below? If your country and country code is not on the list, unfortunately, you cannot use phone alerts at this time. Please [let us know]([LINK_URL_1]) if your country is not on the list.
2.  If your country and country code is on the list of **supported countries** below and you're not receiving alert phone calls, please **try another outgoing phone number**. You can change the outgoing phone number in the **Phone alerts integration settings** as described in [Phone (voice) alert setup]([LINK_URL_2]).
3.  Verify that the [operator's phone number]([LINK_URL_3]) is correct and that their country code is on the list of supported countries and codes below.
