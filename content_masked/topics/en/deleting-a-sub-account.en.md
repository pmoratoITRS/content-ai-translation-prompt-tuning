Deleting a sub account is pretty straightforward; you remove the operators and then delete the sub account. However, we've got a few tips for you that will make deleting sub accounts and sub-account operators a little easier, especially if you manage several sub accounts.

## Delete a sub account

 We recommend that you delete the sub account operators before deleting the sub account. Why? While the sub account is active, you can easily identify the operators of a given sub account on the [SHORTCODE_3]Operators[SHORTCODE_4] page.

1. Open the operator hub by going to ([SHORTCODE_5]Account setup > Operators, groups and sub accounts[SHORTCODE_6]).
2. Open the sub account settings page by clicking the [SHORTCODE_7] View all sub accounts [SHORTCODE_8] button.
3. Click on the sub account you want to delete.
2. Navigate to the [SHORTCODE_9]Operators[SHORTCODE_10] tab.
4. Delete the operators (see [Sub account operator management]([LINK_URL_1]) for operator deletion instructions). The **Member of groups** column will help you identify the sub account operators.
5. Navigate to [SHORTCODE_11]Account setup > Monitor groups[SHORTCODE_12].
6. Click to open the monitor group for the sub account.
7. Click [SHORTCODE_13]Delete this monitor group[SHORTCODE_14].
8. Go back to the sub account's settings page.
9. Click [SHORTCODE_15]Delete this sub account[SHORTCODE_16].

**Note**: Just removing the operators from the sub account without deleting them gives the orphaned sub-account operators access to a read-only view of the primary account. Following the procedure outlined above helps you to avoid orphaned sub-account operators.
