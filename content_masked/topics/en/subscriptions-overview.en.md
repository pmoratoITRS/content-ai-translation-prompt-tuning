You need a subscription to use the Uptrends app (after a 30-day trial period). Please see the [pricing overview]([LINK_URL_1]) for more information on the available subscription plans.
Once you have a subscribed to a plan, you can handle many things related to your subscription yourself, like [Adding extra monitors and credits]([LINK_URL_2]), renewing your subscription (in the app go to [SHORTCODE_1] Account setup > Renew [SHORTCODE_2]) or checking the actual subscription and invoices (in the app open [SHORTCODE_3] Account setup > Subscription and invoices [SHORTCODE_4]).

If you have questions about your account that are not covered in the knowledge base articles, please contact [Support]([LINK_URL_3]) by entering a ticket.
