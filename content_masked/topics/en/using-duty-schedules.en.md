Alerts are a great way of staying in sync with the status of your monitored services, but there are times when you simply don’t want to receive any alerts – namely, when you’re not working! For such a situation, we have created something called **Off-duty schedules**.

## What is an off-duty schedule?

An off-duty schedule is a schedule used to define when an operator is off duty, to ensure that they only receive alerts when they are working. Schedules can be set to occur *once, daily*, *weekly*, or *monthly*.

## How to use an off-duty schedule

Adding an off-duty schedule to an operator is quite simple, and can be changed whenever you’d like.

Note that when adding an off-duty schedule the time and date of your main Uptrends account are used. Any date and time of the local computer (where you are editing the off-duty schedule) are ignored. This simplifies things when you are working with operators in different time zones as the off-duty schedules will be based on the Uptrends account time/date only.

1.  Log into your Uptrends account.
2.  Navigate to the [SHORTCODE_3]Operators[SHORTCODE_4] page, located within the [SHORTCODE_5]Accounts[SHORTCODE_6] dropdown menu.
3.  You will see a list of operators found within your account. Select the one you’d like to add an off-duty schedule for.
4.  Now you’re in the operator settings wizard. Click on the tab labeled [SHORTCODE_7]Off-duty Schedules[SHORTCODE_8].
5.  You will then see a list of existing off-duty schedules. (If not, click [SHORTCODE_9]Add Off-duty schedule[SHORTCODE_10])
6.  Select the time period you’d like the operator to be listed as unavailable, and click [SHORTCODE_11]Set[SHORTCODE_12].
7.  When you’re done, click the [SHORTCODE_13]Save[SHORTCODE_14] button.
