## Accessing API v4 using Swagger

All Uptrends API methods are available on the [Uptrends OpenAPI (Swagger) page]([LINK_URL_2]). This page describes all API methods in detail and lets you execute each method individually.

You can use our Swagger specification and Swagger Codegen to generate client code and integrate the Uptrends API in your scripts or applications. To learn more about Swagger and Swagger tools, visit [Swagger.io]([LINK_URL_3]).

## Endpoints

The following API endpoints are currently supported:

The Operator Group API also lets you create off-duty schedules for all operators in a group. For more information, see [Operator Group API documentation]([LINK_URL_9]).

### Alert API

The Alert API contains methods for managing alerts. For more information, see [Alert API]([LINK_URL_10]).

### Alert Definitions API
