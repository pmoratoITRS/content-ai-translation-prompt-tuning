Your Uptrends account is the central place for managing users ([operators]([LINK_URL_1])), checking [payments and subscriptions]([LINK_URL_2]), invoices, and maintaining general settings.

Go to [SHORTCODE_1] Account setup > Account settings [SHORTCODE_2]. On the [SHORTCODE_3] Settings [SHORTCODE_4] tab you'll find a number of general settings like the [time zone]([LINK_URL_3]), language, default dashboard to show, and login options like [single sign-on]([LINK_URL_4]) and [two-factor authentication]([LINK_URL_5]). Note that the settings here are the default for the whole Uptrends account and apply to all users. However, several settings can be changed individually by the user, e.g. each user may set their own language.
