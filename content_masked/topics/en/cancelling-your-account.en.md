We are very sad to see you leave us! If there is any way that we can change your mind, possibly by helping you set something up, or answering a question, [please let us know]([LINK_URL_1]). Otherwise, read on to learn how to cancel your account.

## How do I cancel my account?

### Free accounts

To close a free account, please [file a support ticket]([LINK_URL_2]) requesting deactivation of your account.

### Trial accounts

If you don't want to continue the trial, you can simply let your account expire. As we promised, your trial account comes with zero commitment.

You can also cancel your trial account earlier by clicking the **Cancel my trial** link from the upper-left menu. If you can't see this button, go to the [SHORTCODE_3]  Account settings  [SHORTCODE_4] menu > [SHORTCODE_5] Subscription [SHORTCODE_6] tab, and click the [SHORTCODE_7] Cancel my trial [SHORTCODE_8] button.

This opens the **Trial cancellation** page, where you can select any of the following: [SHORTCODE_9] Speak to one of our consultants [SHORTCODE_10] for assistance, [SHORTCODE_11] I want to keep my trial [SHORTCODE_12], or proceed with the cancellation.

Selecting the [SHORTCODE_13] Yes, cancel my trial [SHORTCODE_14]
button discontinues your trial account. You must fill out and submit a form, which helps us collect valuable feedback to improve our service and the user experience.

Once the form is submitted, you'll be automatically logged out, and your account will be closed.

### Paid accounts

To close a paid account, please [file a support ticket]([LINK_URL_3]) requesting deactivation of your account.

**Note:** Just in case you reconsider leaving, we keep your data and monitor information in the system for 14 days after the expiration or deactivation of your account.
