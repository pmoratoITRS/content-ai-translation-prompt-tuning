The main menu will look similar to the following image. Depending on the products you have subscribed to, you will find [Synthetics]([LINK_URL_1]), [Real User Monitoring]([LINK_URL_2]), and [Infra]([LINK_URL_3]) in the menu.
If you are not an administrator you will not have access to all settings.

## Menu pinning

The main menu can be pinned/unpinned by clicking the left/right arrow at the top of the menu. While unpinned, the menu will be minimized until you hover over it to expand the menu. By unpinning the menu you can get it out of the way and have more space to show dashboards or setup pages.

## Trials

When using a trial account, there are menu entries to add a trial for products you are not using or trying out yet.
In a paid account, the trials are available in a different location. They can be found in the [SHORTCODE_3] Account setup [SHORTCODE_4] menu.

## Menu icons

Within different submenus you can come across similar menu entries. They have icons to distinguish the type of menu entry. You may see the following icons in front of menu entries:

[SHORTCODE_5][SHORTCODE_6] - Dashboard

[SHORTCODE_7][SHORTCODE_8] - Hub (explore)

[SHORTCODE_9][SHORTCODE_10] - Settings (view/edit)

[SHORTCODE_11][SHORTCODE_12] - Knowledge base article
