First you need to know where and how to add new operators (or operator groups) in general. Check out our KB article [Add or delete an operator]([LINK_URL_1]) to get started with the basics.

When you have added a new operator you'll reach the operator settings page which has several tabs for the configuration of the user account. Check out the following knowledge base articles to find out about the related operator tab settings.

[SHORTCODE_1] Main [SHORTCODE_2] — contact details, login info, and personal settings like the default dashboard or timezone are explained in the knowledge base article [Main settings]([LINK_URL_2]).

[SHORTCODE_3] Off-duty schedules [SHORTCODE_4] — off-duty schedules for operators are discussed in [Duty schedules]([LINK_URL_3]).

[SHORTCODE_5] Member of [SHORTCODE_6] — you can find background info in [Operator groups]([LINK_URL_4]) and [Operator admin rights]([LINK_URL_5]).

[SHORTCODE_7] Permissions [SHORTCODE_8] — holds the configuration of who will be able to access what, which is explained in the article [Permissions]([LINK_URL_6]).

[SHORTCODE_9] API management [SHORTCODE_10] - lets you add API accounts/credentials to an operator which are needed to make calls using [Uptrends' API]([LINK_URL_7]). Follow the instructions in [Operator API management]([LINK_URL_8]) to add or remove API accounts.

Within the Uptrends application, you can find the [User management hub]([LINK_URL_9]) for a quick and easy overview of the operators in your account.
