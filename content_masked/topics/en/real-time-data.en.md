When someone visits your website, the data collected by the RUM script in your pages will be sent to us as soon as the page is done loading. Your data is then queued for processing, but seeing those pageviews in the RUM reports in your Uptrends account should usually be a matter of minutes. No need to wait until the next day to see any results.

That said - while your reports will always show very recent data, our recommendation is to mainly use Real User Monitoring data as a tool for watching trends. This doesn't have to be limited to week- or month-long trends: it will also work for considering the perceived performance by your users during the hours before and after you did an update of your website.

However, if you need up-to-the-minute uptime and load time checks, we recommend using our high frequency [Synthetic Monitoring]([LINK_URL_1]) side by side with RUM to keep an eye on both.
