[Operators]([LINK_URL_1]) are the user accounts in the Uptrends app. They are managed by an administrator and each operator belongs to at least one [operator group]([LINK_URL_2]). Operators have their own login credentials unless they are using single sign-on as only login option. The administrator has access to all settings for the operator and the operator may adjust a few of them, e.g. the language, timezone or default dashboard, to their preference.
