[SHORTCODE_1]
**Note:** Transaction Screenshots are available in the **Enterprise version** and **Business version**.
[SHORTCODE_2]

When monitoring transactions it can be easy to get lost in the details of all of the data that is being communicated across a web page. To help make this task less daunting, we offer screenshots for transactions.

## Why use Transaction Screenshots?

This option is useful when trying to track down a specific error, or if you wish to see what a particular page looked like on a specific time and day. You can decide which steps youâ€™d like a screenshot of, and we will provide the screenshot at the end of that step.

## When does Uptrends generate a Screenshot?

We generate a screenshot in the following occassions:

-   **By default:** when an error occurs during a transaction. You don't have to set anything up, this happens automatically.
-   **Ad-hoc:** When you have activated a Transaction Screenshot in a specific step, after the step completed.

## How do I set it up?

[SHORTCODE_3]
**Just to be sure:** you'll need a transaction to start activating Transaction Screenshots.
[SHORTCODE_4]

-   Go to [SHORTCODE_5]Monitors[SHORTCODE_6] in the top menu, and select the transaction you would like to activate screenshots for.
-   In the [SHORTCODE_7]Steps[SHORTCODE_8] tab, select the step you want to activate a screenshot for.
-   Check the checkbox that says **Screenshot**, and we'll generate a screenshot every time the step has been completed.

## Where can I find Transaction Screenshots?

Transaction Screenshots are displayed in the *Monitor Log* (Monitors > Monitor Log). When you click on a specific transaction check, we'll display the steps that are executed. If a step contains a screenshot, you can click the tiny camera icon to reveal it.
