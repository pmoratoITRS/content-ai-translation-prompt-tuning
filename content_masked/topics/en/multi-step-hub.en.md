The **Multi-step API (MSA) hub** provides a general overview of MSAs and your MSA monitoring setup. To open this page, go to [SHORTCODE_1] API > [SHORTCODE_2] [Explore API monitoring]([LINK_URL_1]) menu. In the sidebar menu, you'll find links to relevant knowledge base articles:

The following cards display your API monitor setup:

- The **API monitors** card shows the number of your monitor setups. Clicking the [SHORTCODE_3] View all API monitors [SHORTCODE_4] button opens the API monitors overview or the [SHORTCODE_5]  API monitors setup [SHORTCODE_6] menu.

- The **API monitor status** card shows the number of monitors with [confirmed errors]([LINK_URL_3]) and active alerts. Clicking the [SHORTCODE_7] View monitor status [SHORTCODE_8] button opens the **Monitors status** page. Clicking the [SHORTCODE_9] View ongoing alerts [SHORTCODE_10] button opens the **Current alert status** page.

- The Active monitors card shows the API monitors in [Staging and Production mode]([LINK_URL_4]).

- The API credits card shows your API credits balance. To buy more credits, refer to [Adding extra monitors and credits]([LINK_URL_5]).

The hub also features a way to automatically scan your existing monitors and identify those that can be converted into [API monitors]([LINK_URL_6]). If it detects any HTTP or HTTPS monitors that appear to check an API endpoint, it will offer the option to automatically create a new API monitor for you.

This functionality instantly upgrades any [Uptime monitor]([LINK_URL_7]) into a fully configured API monitor without deleting or modifying the original monitor. You can freely undo the action at any time if needed. Additionally, there's no need to manually recreate everything from scratch, Uptrends handles all the setup, replicating the same settings from your existing monitors.

Clicking the **See details** button opens a pop-up that lets you convert your existing monitor into an API monitor. Once converted, another pop-up will appear to let you review the configuration and enable the newly created monitor for use.
