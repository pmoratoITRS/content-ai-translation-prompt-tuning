In some cases, the name of the monitor that caused an alert is not suitable for text-to-speech conversion. To make your phone alerts understandable, you can enable **speech-friendly monitor names**. To enable speech-friendly monitor names:

1.  Navigate to **Alerts** > **Integrations** on the [SHORTCODE_3]Main[SHORTCODE_4] menu.
2.  Click your phone integration to open the editor.
3.  Select the checkbox labeled **Use alternate monitor names**.
4.  Click [SHORTCODE_5]Save[SHORTCODE_6].
5.  Navigate to **Monitors** > **Monitors** on the *Main* menu.
6.  Click to open a monitor that uses phone alerts.
7.  Type a text-to-speech friendly name alternative in the box labeled **Name for phone alerts** located on the [SHORTCODE_7]Main[SHORTCODE_8] tab.
8.  Click [SHORTCODE_9]Save[SHORTCODE_10].

## Configuring the ideal speech-friendly name

At this moment, we don't have a test function available to demonstrate how the monitor name sounds in a phone alert message. Therefore, you may need to experiment before finding the best sounding option.

[SHORTCODE_1]
**Tip:** Changing the language of the phone alert can also help to achieve the best pronunciation. You can change the language for the phone alert in the **Phone integration screen** (Alerts > Integrations).
