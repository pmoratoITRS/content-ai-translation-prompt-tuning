When selecting your checkpoints, remember that a checkpoint operates within the Internet infrastructure of the given area. If you choose checkpoint locations within emerging markets, their Internet infrastructure is still developing. Typically, these areas have inconsistent connectivity and lower bandwidth available to users and Uptrends' checkpoints. The reduced performance of the Internet infrastructure will appear in your monitoring results, but those results are still consistent with the experience of your users in that area. As the infrastructure improves in these emerging markets, your monitoring reports will reflect those improvements.
